                        <p>Our current emphasis is on aiding tech start-ups that have secured seed funding and
                            <br></br>moved beyond the ideation phase. We hold the belief that start-ups at this juncture hold
                            <br></br>more significant potential for success and are better poised to provide value to both their
                            <br></br>customers and investors</p>
                        <p>Through our stipulation of seed funding, our intention is to ascertain that the start-ups
                            <br></br>we engage with possess a proven concept and have exhibited their capability to attract
                            <br></br>investments. This enables us to concentrate our resources and assistance on start-ups
                            <br></br>that exhibit a greater potential for success, thereby increasing the probability of yielding
                            <br></br>returns for our investors.</p>

                            <br></br>tech start-up, our conviction lies in the notion that extending support during the seed
                            <br></br>funding phase can wield a more substantial influence on the start-up's prosperity. This
                            <br></br>developmental stage usually demands advanced expertise, strategic counsel, and
                            <br></br>operational backing - areas in which our capabilities are most adept</p>
