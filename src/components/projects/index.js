                Our current emphasis is on aiding tech start-ups that have secured seed funding and
                <br></br>moved beyond the ideation phase. We hold the belief that 
                <br></br>start-ups at this juncture hold more significant potential for 
                <br></br>success and are better poised to provide value to both their customers and investors

              <p className=" text-white text-sm font-normal leading-relaxed">
                Through our stipulation of seed funding, our intention is to ascertain that the start-ups
                <br></br>we engage with possess a proven concept and have exhibited their capability to attract
                <br></br>investments. This enables us to concentrate our resources and 
                <br></br>assistance on start-ups that exhibit a greater potential for success, 
                <br></br>thereby increasing the probability of yielding returns for our investors.

              <p className=" text-white text-sm font-normal leading-relaxed">Though we acknowledge the ingenuity and novelty involved in conceptualizing a new
                <br></br>tech start-up, our conviction lies in the notion that extending support during the seed
                <br></br>funding phase can wield a more substantial influence on the start-up's prosperity. This
                <br></br>developmental stage usually demands advanced expertise, strategic counsel, and
                <br></br>operational backing - areas in which our capabilities are most adept</p>
